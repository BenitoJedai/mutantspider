simple example of using mutantspider tools to build a web page that contains an element
that is handled by some C++ code.

Getting Started:

First thing, in a console window try cd'ing to this directory (the one with this README file in it)
and then execute:

	make run_server
	
If this succeeds it will have compiled the C++ code and built a simple web site that includes
the compiled code.  It will also have launched a simple web server on that site.  You can see this
web page by opening a browser of you choice and going to:

	http://localhost:5103
