<h2>Mutantspider implementation</h2>

<b>README.makefile</b><br>
Documentation on mutantspider.mk and suggestions on how to construct good Makefiles

<b>library_mutantspider.js</b><br>
An Emscripten-style "library" implementing the bridge from C++ to mutantspider.js as well
as a few other things

<b>library_pbmemfs.js</b><br>
An Emscripten-style "library" implementing an improved version of emcc's IDBFS

<b>library_rezfs.js</b><br>
An Emscripten-style "library" implementing the javascript side of mutantspider's "resource"
file system support.  The C++ side is automatically generated by mutantspider.mk, based on
the <code>$(RESOURCES)</code> make variable

<b>mutantspider.cpp</b><br>
Glue code for the C++ side of the mutantspider API

<b>mutantspider.h</b><br>
Primary interface file for C++ code using mutantspider.  It is largely a simple wrapper
around a (small) subset of NaCl's Pepper API

<b>mutantspider.js</b><br>
Simple programming interface for the javascript side of a mutantspider client.  It also
contains most of the support code for Emscripten builds, allowing the javascript code to
emulate the Pepper API

<b>mutantspider.mk</b><br>
Primary makefile that implements the mutantspider build support mechanism

<b>mutantspider_fs.cpp</b><br>
Some URL handling support code for the Emscripten emulation of Pepper

<b>mutantspider_js_file.h</b><br>
Interface file for URL support code
