  <h1>File System Test</h1>
  <h2>Status: <code id="statusField">NO-STATUS</code></h2>
  <p>Loading this page will test various aspects of the mutantspider file system code.  The first time
  it runs on your system (or the first time it runs after you have cleared your browser's history cache)
  the browser may tell you the page is requesting permission to store data locally.  Clicking "ok" or
  "yes" will allow the test to run correctly.</p>
  <p>The "persistent" tests exercise your browser's logic for storing information locally across page
  views.  Each time you reload this page it checks for data that it might have written during a previous
  view of this page.  If it finds it, it validates that it is correct and then deletes it.  If it doesn't
  find it, it writes it.  So it flips back and forth between the two states each time you view the page.
  The logic is based on the html5 'IndexedDB' service for a javascript build, and Google's 'html5fs'
  service on a PNaCl build.  You can see which build you are running in the 'Status' field at the top
  of this page.  If your browser doesn't support PNaCl, and doesn't support IndexedDB then the test will
  fail.</p>
  <p>The "resource" tests exercise the build system's ability to copy resource-like files from the build
  machine, into the executable itself in such a way that the code can access the files using standard
  <code>fopen</code> and <code>fread</code> calls.  You can read about how this feature works in the
  <code>mutantspider/src/README.makefile</code> file - search for "Resources".</p>
  <p>The lines below this are the test that is being tried.  If the line is normal, black text then that
  test passed.  In many cases the code is testing something which is supposed to <i>not</i> work - for
  example writing to a read-only file.  In these cases the test is verifying that the operation failed
  and set errno correctly.  If a line is printed in <span class="error">red</span> then it indicates that
  that test failed.  <span class="heading">Bold</span> lines are usually just information about the state
  of the testing itself.  Thes are not tests themselves.</p>
